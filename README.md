Java code that sorts array.

Using the sort() Method
In Java, Arrays is the class defined in the java.util package that provides sort() method to sort an array in ascending order. It uses Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm for sorting. Its complexity is O(n log(n)). It is a static method that parses an array as a parameter and does not return anything. We can invoke it directly using the class name. It accepts an array of type int, float, double, long, char, byte.




Let's sort an array using the sort() method of the Arrays class.

In the following program, we have defined an array of type integer. After that, we have invoked the sort() method of the Arrays class and parses the array to be sort. For printing the sorted array, we have used for loop.
